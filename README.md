# Bayesian Flow Networks

This repo is a simple replication of the discrete and discretised implementations of Bayesian flow networks (BFNs).

The original paper can be found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07037.pdf

The official code implementation here: https://github.com/nnaisense/bayesian-flow-networks

In this repo we:

- Replicate simple toy examples for discrete and discretised datasets.
- Train a discretised model on the CIFAR-10 dataset. (to do)
- Train a discrete model on the Dynamically Binarised MNIST dataset. (to do)


### Discretised Toy Examples

Samples from ground truth dataset and samples from discretised BFN
