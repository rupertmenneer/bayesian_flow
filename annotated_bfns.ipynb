    "# Bayesian Flow Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'Bayesian Flow Networks' paper is a new generative modelling approach proposed by Alex Graves et al (2023). The paper sets out a general mathematical framework to transform a known distribution into a target distribution for Continuous, Discretised Continuous and Discrete settings. Although, closely related to Diffusion based models it differs in several key aspects. This notebook will run through each step trying to make the process as clear as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the paper starts with the 'general' framework and then customises it to each of the use cases, this post will focus first on the discrete case.\n"
